preview: This is the first post of, hopefully, many regarding the state and future prospects of MSU Basketball and Football. Some background, I'm a former MSU student with absolutely no expertise in either major sport I will be talking about, but a lot of dumb opinions I hope y'all will entertain. My formative years were growing up in East Lansing during the Izzo heyday from 1998-2005 so I consider myself a bigger fan of basketball (thank you John L. Smith) but that will fluctuate based on football success or lack thereof. My goal with this is to one day look back on my horrible takes and laugh.

This is the first post of, hopefully, many regarding the state and future prospects of MSU Basketball and Football. Some background, I'm a former MSU student with absolutely no expertise in either major sport I will be talking about, but a lot of dumb opinions I hope y'all will entertain. My formative years were growing up in East Lansing during the REAL Izzo heyday (fight me) from 1998-2005 so I consider myself a bigger fan of basketball (thank you John L.

I'm pretty positive about MSU Basketball at the moment. The opening week vs. Eastern MI and Notre Dame went as smoothly as should be expected. Hot takes are as follows:
#### 1. Mady Sissoko has Wacky Inflatable Flailing Arm Guy Arms
There's nothing extra to this one. His debut against Eastern was laughable (in a good way). Dude is nuts. He's got every physical tool imaginable and will block the ever-loving hell out of a few shots per year? Game? Hopefully game. Because if Mady realizes his potential, this man will be a lottery pick.
#### 2. Aaron Henry is an NBA Player
Aaron Henry played like a real NBA player tonight. Not a really good one, his offense has big holes, but one I'd be happy to have on the Pistons (God help us). His defense was suffocating ACC players without even breaking a sweat. Dude looks like a stud out there when he's on, and seems to have a professional approach. The major concern is the offense where he looked decent but awkward going to the basket and pretty shaky from outside. I'd feel better about his shooting if his free throw % was better but its not. Given his (what seems like) very professional dedication to improving, I have no doubt he WILL be a career NBA player in the future. But I don't think he'll be a big contributor immediately. But let's be real, focused on the now dude is spectacular and MSU couldn't ask for a better leader.
#### 3. AJ Hoggard Looked P Good, My Dude
I was struck by A.J. Hoggard's ball handling tonight. I don't know his status re: if he's injured or out of shape or what, but dude looked super comfortable handling the ball against ACC level opposition. A big warning sign for freshmen, ESPECIALLY point guards, is if they look uncomfortable or rushed. He did not. I'm strongly encouraged that AJ will be a strong 3rd PG off the bench going forward as his conditioning/injury situation improve. AJ Hoggard has NBA potential.
#### 4. Amazing Defense, Offense is Concerning
As a team the defense looked incredible. Granted, neither EMU or ND are going to overwhelm you with talent but the team did exactly what they were supposed to do. During the ND game in particular the team looked like they could shut down ND's offense whenever they wanted. It's a feeling you usually get watching Duke or Kentucky play in early NCAA tourney rounds, where the talent gap is just too much. On the other hand, the offense while competent, didn't look the sharpest. It looked like MSU had their way with ND's defense when they decided to put the petal to the metal, but I don't know how to explain, but it didn't feel natural. I feel like relying on Joey Hauser for significant point is not good. Against good teams I worry this team will struggle handling the ball and then offense will suffer. I expect defense to hold up, but our struggles to score will likely bite us against the Gonzagas or Dukes of the world. But hey, I thought the same before Matt McQuaid put Javin DeLaurier an a <b>god damned</b> poster so we'll see.

## Football

Football as usual is less positive. But given news outside the conference I have half-hearted hope for the future. Hot takes are as follows:

#### 1. I Bet My Friend Patrick We'd Start the Year With Rocky Lombardi and End It With Payton Thorne and Fuck You I Stand By My Prediction
For what at the time seemed like a pre-workout-crazed rant, this prediction looks pretty god-damned good right now. Rocky Lombardi, while showing signs of... <b>not</b> absolute garbage status, hasn't been completely convincing. Rocky seems like a great leader to learn D1 through Pro level habits from but I do not see him as the true inheritor to a high-level MSU program. Especially given Payton Thorne is waiting in the wings with 3 years of eligibility left to Rocky's 1. In my opinion, Rocky is an average at best DI P5 QB who has his place bridging this year. But the future wins out. I still believe Payton Thorne will end the year the starter.

#### 2. Defense is... OK??? Maybe?
The defense has a few genuine bright spots, though I wish we had more. Looking to the future, Naquan Jones, Michael Fletcher, Shakur Brown, Xavier Henderson, Angelo Grose (Bob Sanders 2.0) look like they can be the core of a solid defense in the next year or more. I expect our only draft pick (keeping the streak alive baby) this year to be Antjuan Simmons. Tough I hope I'm wrong. 

#### 3. This Is A Bridge Year, Eyes to the Future
This year is a wash. We're 2-3, and COVID made it pointless anyway. Let's look at the prospects ahead. D'wan Mathis has left Georgia. A former MSU commit, early rumblings have him looking our way. This is literally me talking out of my drunken ass though so take that for what its worth. But next year, given D'wan decides to come on board, our offense might actually have some substance to it. With the Oline (hopefully) improving, and all the skill positions returning their top players (Jayden Reed, Jalen Nailor, Ricky White, Trenton Gillison, Elijah Collins, Jordan Simmons) we might have a pulse in 2021. If we can score 28.5+ points per game, I trust Mel and the defense to get us through to a decent bowl game. Even without D'wan, we should expect regression to an average P5 offense moving forward.
