preview: During a "play around with Python" notebook session I was struck with the idea to make a Flight Tracker app. While a lot of these already exist, I found few if any that were both A. not shady, and B. not over-the-top complex. It struck me as something I could make relatively quickly and easily to hone my skills building software and working in a cloud ecosystem. This article is a placeholder while I work on a full explainer and tutorial.
