preview: So you'll find I slack at posting when we suck. And we suck. OR DO WE!? Nah jk, pretty sure we suck. But it's important to keep it in context. While we suck by MSU basketball standards we're still a good bet to make the tournament for a couple reasons. 1. A strong OOC resume, 2. Tom Izzo. I have faith that we can endure and limp across the line into a tournament birth (pls) based on Izzo's brilliant history. That said, if I'm wrong I am fully prepared to accept my sentence of 10 Saturdays without Dr. Pepper.
