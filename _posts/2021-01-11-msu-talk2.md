preview: So you'll find I slack at posting when we suck. And we suck. OR DO WE!? Nah jk, pretty sure we suck. But it's important to keep it in context. While we suck by MSU basketball standards we're still a good bet to make the tournament for a couple reasons. 1. A strong OOC resume, 2. Tom Izzo. I have faith that we can endure and limp across the line into a tournament birth (pls) based on Izzo's brilliant history. That said, if I'm wrong I am fully prepared to accept my sentence of 10 Saturdays without Dr. Pepper.

So I'm fully aware that I am in fact, immature as hell. And because of that, when we suck at basketball, I try to regulate by not watching as much. This is of course to avoid heartache and frustration. But to be fair to myself, we have been PRETTY disappointing recently. In my last MSU talk article I wrote with an optimistic outlook, but now things have gotten a lot more nervy. In particular Rocket Watts and Josh Langford seem nowhere to be found and Marcus Bingham has been pretty disappointing. But before this dissolves into an unfocused rant I will try to pick out a few points to focus on.

#### 1. Have Faith in Izzo
This may be a little self-comfort, but its also based in fact. Izzo is a hall of fame coach and he knows how to get the best out of players. The season isn't totally off the rails yet. We still have the time and talent to pull things together. The Big10 championship has already sailed in my opinion, so the focus should be on making the tournament. With Izzo and the talent we have available we SHOULD be able to squeeze in, and if we do I would consider making the 2nd round a success and the 2nd weekend a very strong success. No matter what happens the rest of the way I intend to bask in the glory of Big10 basketball while we have it. Because it can be quickly derailed.

#### 2. C'mon Marcus
Marcus Bingham... cmon man. You're a 10ft tall behemoth, we need you out there in big moments. It's a fact that no one on this team has the physical gifts Marcus Bingham has its on him and the coaching staff to pull a good player out of him. The best comp I can think of is Adrien Payne. Coming out of high school I remember Payne as a raw but gifted guy that had length and athleticism to spare. By the end of his career we saw a strong 1st round pick. Given the similarities I had hoped for similar development from Bingham. To date, that has not worked out, dude cannot get off the bench. While that's partly because Malik Hall has been great, Malik simply does not give you the same skillset as a developed Bingham. I think its fair to say that if Bingham had been on the floor boxing out that huge dude I'm too lazy to look up, we would have gotten that rebound. Unfortunately Marcus hasnt shown the kind of fundementals or strength required to be trusted in a crunch scenario like that. To me, if a guy of Binghams potential is not reaching it, it is on the coaching staff to pull it out of him. These kids are 18/19/20, they aren't professionals and they need guidance on the path to a professional level of performance. The coaching staff needs to step things up and help Marcus reach his ceiling.

#### 3. I Still Love Aaron Henry
Thats it.

## Football
Ya uhhhhh... I got nothing. Next time I'll be looking at the recent transfers in and out.
